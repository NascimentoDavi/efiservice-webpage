This is a Web Page project made for the company I'm currently working at. I'm building that using HTML and Bootstrap on its inner struture and separated CSS code to implement some features.
As simple unique page, the problems I had faced when desining the main structure were make it be responsive, however, gathering my previous knowledge on these technologies and the Bootstrap facilities, I could overcome these issues.
By the way, it's necessary to add JavaScript features to make it work as well as I planned on the beggining, like, for example, receiving data from forms, animations on buttons clicks and so on so forth.

The navbar was made thiking in simpicity and responsivity, as mentioned above. when the screen isn't big enough, only some options are displayed, avoiding problems.
Below the first options of the site, we can see a carousel with three stages, to show the main promotions and sales.
After that, some boxes showing important information regarding the company, to convince the client concerning it good points.
Then, another little interactive carousel with images of the products which the company manages, besides 6 cars displayed responsivly showing information about those ones.

<strong>Simple, feasible and efficient.</strong>
